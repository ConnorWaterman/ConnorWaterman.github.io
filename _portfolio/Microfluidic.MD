# Introduction



# Design

The asymmetric design was inspired by [this]() paper by ***** et.al. In theory, this design allows for finer sorting, better control of the flow rate through each channel, a more compact footprint, and a cooler look. 

The design started in Autodesk Fusion. I utilized three channels, one for the finer particles, one for the larger particles and one drain channel to sink the majority of the flow through. Each channel was the same length so that hydraulic resistance was a function of channel width alone.
