# Introduction

polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) silicone is commonly used to create microfluidic devices from molds because of its low viscosity and biocompatibility.

# Design

The asymmetric design was inspired by [this]() paper by ***** et.al. In theory, this design allows for finer sorting, better control of the flow rate through each channel, a more compact footprint, and a cooler look. 

The design started in Autodesk Fusion. I utilized three channels, one for the finer particles, one for the larger particles and one drain channel to sink the majority of the flow through. Each channel was the same length so that hydraulic resistance was a function of channel width alone. 

# Production

The mold was printed in clear resin on the Formlabs Form 4. 25 micron layers were used for maximum dimensional accuracy. After printing, the part was carefully cleaned to ensure that absolutely no liquid resin remained on the surface. After a short 1 minute cure, the mold was parlyene coated to prevent liquid monomer from leaching into the uncured PDMS silicone. Any amount of leaching will cause the PDMS not to cure properly. Once cured, the device was removed from the mold and bonded to a glass microscope slide.
