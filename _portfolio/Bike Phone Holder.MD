# Top Down Modeling

Top down modeling is a CAD modeling approach where components and subassemblies are created within the context of a top level assembly.

# Design

  My intent with the design was to create a compact and robust mount with secure and satisfying detent mating. The detent design uses a 90 degree crossed arrangement of interlocking hemispherical profiles. The interlocked assembly is held together with a central tension spring. The end loops of the central spring are retaind by captive cylindrical pins to allow for infinite rotation in either direction without damaging the spring. The lower female mating plate is affixed to the fixed handlebar clamp using 4, M3 screws and threaded heat set inserts. The upper male plate is attached to the fixed arm of the phone mount in the same manner. A stiff central spring is required to kepp the halves together when the phone is held at an angle. The handle bar clamping mechanism has an upper fixed arm, and a lower pivoting arm. An M3 screw and heat set are used as the hinge pin. The two halves are tightened around the handlebar with another M3 screw and heat set. Hemispherical bars are placed under the screw head and around the heat set to distribute tension throughout the width of clamping arms, and to compensate for small differences in handle bar diameter. The phone mount uses a sliding prismatic joint optimized for filament 3D printing to constrain the motion of the moving arm. Another tension spring is used to tightly squeeze the a range of sizes of phones between the rigid grips. Proper joint clearances were necessary for smooth sliding without wobble, so the joint was designed to not require supports when printing either component.

# Part

All parts were filament 3D printed in PLA.
