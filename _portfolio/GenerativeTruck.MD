# Perserve and Obstacle Geometry

The hanger pivot, central bushing mounting faces, axle ends, and motor mounting plate were designed based off of the Paris manufacturer CAD and physical measurements and used as preserve geometry. 

The obstacle geometry had to account not only for the static position of the motor, belt, pulleys, wheels, board deck, baseplate, bushings and kingpin, but also allow the truck to pivot so the skateboard can turn, and provide installation tool clearance. The wheel and pulley positions are static and were modeled based off of physical measurements. These were to prevent material around the axle that would block installation or rotation. A fastener obstacle was also added through the wheel and axle to prevent material from filling the axle cutout and ensure socket clearance during installation. For the motor obstacle, the motor body was modeled, the motor mounting screw slots were filled, then an additional slot was added on top for bolt head and installation tool clearance.
